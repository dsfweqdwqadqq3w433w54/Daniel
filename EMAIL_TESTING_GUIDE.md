## 📧 Enable Real Email Sending

To send actual emails, choose one of these options:

### Option 1: Web3Forms (Recommended - 2 minutes setup)

1. **Get Access Key**:
   - Go to [https://web3forms.com/](https://web3forms.com/)
   - Enter your email address
   - Click "Create Access Key"
   - Copy the access key

2. **Update Environment**:
   - Open `.env.local`
   - Replace: `VITE_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY=your_web3forms_access_key_here`
   - With: `VITE_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY=your_actual_key`
   - Change: `VITE_DEMO_MODE=false`

3. **Restart Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Test Real Emails**:
   - Try replying to a message
   - Check your email inbox
   - The recipient will receive your reply!

### Option 2: Keep Demo Mode
- Leave `VITE_DEMO_MODE=true` to continue testing
- Perfect for development and testing
- No real emails sent, but you can see what would be sent

## 🎯 How It Works

## 📝 Email Template

[Your reply message]

--- Original Message ---

```
