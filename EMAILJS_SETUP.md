2. Go to your admin dashboard: `http://localhost:5173/#admin`

## ðŸ“§ How It Works

1. **User submits contact form** â†’ Stored in Supabase
2. **Admin clicks Reply** â†’ Opens reply modal
3. **Admin writes reply** â†’ Clicks Send Reply
4. **EmailJS sends email** â†’ Directly to user's inbox
5. **Fallback option** â†’ Opens email client if EmailJS fails

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### EmailJS Not Configured
- If you see "EmailJS configuration needed", check your `.env` file
- Make sure all three variables are set correctly
- Restart your development server after updating `.env`

### Email Not Sending
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Verify your EmailJS service is active
- Make sure your email template variables match
- Check EmailJS dashboard for usage limits

### Gmail Setup Issues
- Enable 2-factor authentication
- Use App Password instead of regular password
- Allow less secure apps (if needed)

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- **Free Plan**: EmailJS free plan allows 200 emails/month
- **Testing**: Use your own email for testing
- **Templates**: You can create multiple templates for different purposes
- **Fallback**: If EmailJS fails, the system will open your email client as backup
