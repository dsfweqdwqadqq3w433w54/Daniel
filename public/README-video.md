# Background Video Setup Instructions

To add a background video to your homepage:

## Video Files
1. Add your background video as `background-video.mp4` in the `public` folder
2. Optionally, add a WebM version as `background-video.webm` for better browser compatibility

## Recommended Video Specifications
- **Duration**: 10-30 seconds (will loop automatically)
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (Full HD) or higher
- **Format**: MP4 (H.264) for best compatibility
- **File Size**: Keep under 10MB for faster loading
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)

## Video Content Suggestions
- Abstract animations
- Subtle particle effects
- Slow-moving geometric patterns
- Nature scenes (clouds, water, etc.)
- Technology-themed animations
- Coding/programming visuals

## Tips for Best Results
- Use videos with subtle movement (not too distracting)
- Avoid videos with text or important details (they'll be covered by overlay)
- Test on different screen sizes
- Consider having a darker video or one that works well with overlays
- Ensure the video loops seamlessly

## Fallback
If no video is provided, the section will show the gradient background as before.

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers support MP4
- WebM provides better compression for supported browsers
- The video will automatically fallback to the gradient background if not supported
